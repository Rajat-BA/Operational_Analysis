### 📩 Action Taken

Based on these insights, a **formal data request** was submitted to the **Operations Manager**. The request outlined the need for specific production data related to:

- Odor compound measurements
- Texture testing (firmness/elasticity)
- Ingredient ratios and sensory evaluations

This data will support further investigation in **Part 2: Process Control & Results**, where control charts and statistical tools will be applied to determine if the production process is in control and capable of producing consistent quality.
